* org-anki
Minor mode to synchronize your org-mode entries to Anki.

Works via [[https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/][AnkiConnect]] add-on to [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki]].[fn:via]

** How
- creates "Basic" type of cards
- heading of org entry is set as card front
- text content until next heading is set as card back[fn:how]

See [[/example/example.org][example.org]] and the [[/example/][resulting screenshots]] for how the cards look
after being synced to Anki.

Both front and back are converted to html.[fn:html-export]

Exposes these commands:
- =org-anki-sync-entry= :: adds or updates the current org-entry under
     cursor
- =org-anki-delete-entry= :: deletes entry from Anki. Entry must have
     =ANKI_NOTE_ID= property

** Setup
- Start Anki with AnkiConnect installed
- Set destination deck name, either as:
  - =(customize-set-variable 'org-anki-default-deck "my-target-deck")= in
    your .emacs
  - =#+ANKI_DECK: my-target-deck= on top of an .org file
  - =:ANKI_DECK: my-target-deck= in the properties' drawer of the item
  - Note that this deck has to be present (created separately in the Anki app)
- Run =anki-sync-entry= on some org item you want to sync

Note: the card browser must be closed while synchronizing, as it won't
update the note otherwise ([[https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect/issues/82][issue]]).

You probably want to bind =org-anki-sync-entry= to a key sequence, but not
=org-anki-delete-entry= -- as accidentally deleting notes will become too
easy.

In any case, don't forget to create backups, as deleting notes will
lose their scheduling information.
** Why
.. as there are [[https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor][anki-editor]], [[https://github.com/abo-abo/pamparam][pamparam]], [[https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill][org-drill]], [[https://github.com/l3kn/org-fc][org-fc]]?

Anki-editor requires subheadings for card front and card back, thus existing .org notes
need to be modified to be ankified. This package takes the heading as
card front and content as card back.

The other three are emacs or org-mode only[fn:others], so no spaced repetition
from your phone or web.
** Todo

See issues.
** Footnotes

[fn:via] AnkiConnect starts a HTTP server on localhost:8765 which the
current package talks to.

[fn:how] It does this even if the next heading is a sub-heading (you
probably don't want subheadings in card contents anyway).

[fn:html-export] Plain org-mode can export to html too but there
didn't appear to be a plain string-to-basic-html function.

[fn:others] I mean, do you really want to use this just to use Anki?? :p
